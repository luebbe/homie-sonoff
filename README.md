# Homie firmware for a Sonoff ESP8266 wifi relay

The software is based on [Homie (v2.0)](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266) and is developed using [PlatformIO](https://github.com/platformio)

The Homie 2.0 framework https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266.git, is *not* included as lib_dep in platformio.ini, because I installed it into the global PlatformIO library storage.
